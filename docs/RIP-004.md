# RIP-004: Continuity Rebalancer Logic (Exploratory)

**Author:** M J — Recur Labs  
**Status:** Draft / Exploratory  
**Created:** October 2025  
**Depends on:** RIP-001 (Permissioned-Pull Standard), RIP-002 (Consent Registry), RIP-003 (Cross-Network Flow Messaging)  

---

## Abstract

RIP-004 defines a minimal, non-custodial **Continuity Rebalancer** logic:  
a consent-bounded mechanism that detects imbalances between accounts or networks and triggers permissioned pulls to restore equilibrium — *without bridges, wrapped assets, or custodial pools.*

The goal is to show that continuous liquidity can remain trustless and revocable even when automation is introduced.  
Rebalancers execute movement **only within signed PPO (Authorization)** limits verified through the Consent Registry.

---

## Motivation

Reactive finance waits for loss; continuity prevents it.  
RIP-004 generalizes the “auto-pull” concept for systemic stability:

* Treasuries may rebalance funds between chains or wallets when deviation > threshold.  
* Protocols may top-up collateral pre-emptively.  
* Stablecoin issuers may smooth liquidity across venues.  

Each action must remain:

- **Consent-bounded** — never exceeding PPO scope.  
- **Revocable** — registry state halts execution instantly.  
- **Observable** — every trigger emits auditable events.

---

## Architecture Overview

| Layer | Component | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Detection | Imbalance Oracle | Computes `delta = observed − target` from balances or feeds. |
| Authorization | Permissioned Pull Object (PPO) | Defines who may rebalance, limits, expiry. |
| Verification | Consent Registry | Confirms revocation / cumulative usage. |
| Execution | RecurRebalancer contract | Calls `pull()` only when consent is valid and imbalance detected. |

## Reference Interface (v0.1)

~~~
interface IRecurConsentRegistry {
    function isRevoked(bytes32 authHash) external view returns (bool);
    function pulledTotal(bytes32 authHash) external view returns (uint256);
}

interface IRecurPull {
    function pull(bytes32 authHash, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract RecurRebalancer {
    event RebalanceTriggered(bytes32 indexed authHash, int256 delta, uint256 amount);
    event RebalanceHalted(bytes32 indexed authHash, string reason);

    function checkImbalance(int256 observed, int256 target) public pure returns (int256 delta);
    function executeRebalance(
        address pullContract,
        bytes32 authHash,
        uint256 amount,
        int256 delta
    ) external returns (bool success);
}
~~~

Implementations SHOULD:
	- Verify !registry.isRevoked(authHash) before any pull.
	- Define delta thresholds for triggering rebalance.
  - Emit events for every trigger / halt for indexers and auditors.
	- Never custody funds or mint wrapped assets.

---  

## Security Considerations  
  - **Revocation First:** Registry state always dominates; revoked PPO → no pull.
  - **Bounded Automation:** Rebalancer MUST reference explicit amount caps.
	- **Oracle Integrity:** If external feeds inform delta, they MUST be verifiable or multi-source.
	- **Replay Resistance:** Each rebalance uses unique authHash + nonce per PPO.

---

## Status & Scope

RIP-004 is **exploratory.**
No production automation logic is released yet.
The current contract (RecurRebalancer.sol) is a verifiable placeholder for future integration with RIP-003 proof relays and Flow Channels.
