#  Recur Integrations & Implementations  
### How Permissioned Pull Primitives Integrate Across Financial Infrastructure  
**Version 1.0 — October 2025**  
Maintained by **Recur Labs**

---

## 1. Purpose  

This brief explains how the Recur permissioned-pull standard can be applied in real-world systems:

- Centralized and decentralized exchanges  
- Treasuries and payment flows  
- Wallets and custodians  
- Compliance and audit frameworks  

It complements the **Technical Paper** (architecture) and **RIP-001** (reference spec).

---

## 2. The Core Primitive  

Recur introduces the **Pull-Permission Object (PPO)**: a signed data object that defines:

- *who* can pull  
- *how much*  
- *how often*  
- *for how long*  

This object can be revoked or modified at any time.  
The logic is defined in `RecurPull.sol`, with events and registries described in **RIP-002**.  

When implemented, any system can move value safely **before failure**, not after, by pre-consented flow.

## 3. Implementation Archetypes  

### (a) Exchanges: Continuous Margin & Settlement  

**Problem:**  
Exchanges liquidate *after* margin breaches, creating cascades.  

**Implementation:**  
- Traders pre-authorize PPOs to the exchange.  
- Exchange systems monitor collateral ratios in real time.  
- When thresholds near limit, the exchange calls `pull()` for partial top-ups.  
- If user revokes consent, positions close gracefully.  

**Impact:**  
Eliminates forced liquidations and contagion events.  
Markets rebalance continuously rather than catastrophically.

---

### (b) DeFi / Treasury Systems: Real-Time Rebalancing  

**Problem:**  
DAO and corporate treasuries rebalance manually or reactively, leaving idle or misallocated capital.  

**Implementation:**  
- PPOs define flow parameters between stablecoin pools, lending markets, and custody accounts.  
- Smart contracts initiate `pull()`s periodically within those permissions.  
- Surplus drains from low-yield pools → safety buffers; deficits auto-refilled.  

**Impact:**  
Automates liquidity management without introducing custodial risk.

---

### (c) Wallets & Custodians: User-Level Consent UX  

**Problem:**  
Recurring payments or approvals are binary — “approve infinite” or “approve again.”  

**Implementation:**  
- Wallets display “Active Consents.”  
- Users set limits: amount, duration, and recipient contract.  
- Revocation uses on-chain `revoke()`; visual confirmation in wallet UI.  

**Impact:**  
Brings consumer-grade recurring flows to crypto, with full user control and instant revocation.

---

### (d) Compliance & Audit Layers: Transparent Authorization Trail  

**Problem:**  
Traditional AML/compliance frameworks rely on ex-post reporting.  

**Implementation:**  
- Each PPO emits structured `Authorize`, `Pull`, and `Revoke` events (per RIP-002).  
- External indexers reconstruct consent history for audit or analytics.  
- Risk engines track activity without intrusive KYC or custody.  

**Impact:**  
Shifts oversight from surveillance to transparency; consent replaces suspicion.

---

## 4. Developer Pathway  

To build on Recur:  

1. Import or extend `RecurPull.sol`.  
2. Define your **authorization UX** (web3 modal, API, etc.).  
3. Listen for events per RIP-002.  
4. Optionally integrate `RecurRegistry` for discovery & revocation lookups.  

SDKs and example dapps are maintained under `/examples`.

Developers can test against the reference PPO SDK at /sdk/ppo.js and /sdk/registry.js (RIP-002-compatible).

---

## 5. Interoperability  

Recur is **EVM-agnostic** and works on any chain or L2 that supports ERC-20 semantics.  
It’s also **AA-compatible**, enabling advanced session policies and gasless UX.  

Planned bridges:  
- Wrapped PPO representation for non-EVM chains (via Wormhole/IBC).  
- Fiat gateway modules for off-ramp integrations.

---

## 6. Strategic Impact  

| Layer | Example | Recur Effect |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Exchange** | Binance, Coinbase | Continuous margin → fewer cascades |
| **Treasury** | DAOs, Corporates | Self-balancing reserves |
| **Wallet** | MetaMask, Safe | Revocable recurring payments |
| **Compliance** | Chainalysis, Fireblocks | Verifiable consent trail |

Recur turns each of these from *reactive systems* into *continuous flow systems.*

---

## 7. Summary  

**Recur = Flow Logic for Value.**  

It defines the mechanism that lets liquidity rebalance within consent — across exchanges, treasuries, and wallets — forming the first true continuity layer of digital finance.  

This is not a company product; it’s a structural upgrade to how value moves.
