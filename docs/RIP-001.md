# RIP-001: The Permissioned-Pull Standard

**Status:** Draft  
**Type:** Standard Track — Core  
**Author:** M J (Recur Labs)  
**Created:** October 2025  
**Requires:** None  
**Replaces:** None

### Abstract

RIP-001 defines the **Permissioned-Pull Standard**, a universal mechanism for consented and continuous transfer of value across digital networks.
It enables accounts to grant revocable authorization for value to be *pulled* within pre-defined parameters rather than *pushed* manually after imbalance or failure.
This structure transforms financial interaction from event-based settlement into continuous equilibrium.

---

### Motivation

All existing payment and settlement systems remain **push-based**; a transaction only occurs after a discrete instruction or event.
This design introduces delay, friction, and reactive volatility: liquidity moves *after* failure, never before.

The Permissioned-Pull Standard introduces **consented continuity**: a programmable way for value to rebalance safely and automatically within user-defined boundaries.
It is the logical next layer of digital finance; complementing ERC-20 and related EVM token standards by defining how consented flow occurs **between accounts** across EVM networks.

### Specification Summary

| **Element** | **Description** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Primitive** | `pull()` — an authorized, revocable value transfer initiated by receiver within granted parameters. |
| **Authorization Object** | A signed data structure defining scope, limits, expiry, and revocation hash. |
| **Revocation Mechanism** | Immediate invalidation through an on-chain or off-chain registry update. |
| **Verification** | ECDSA / EIP-712 signature verifying owner consent and payload integrity. |
| **Compatibility** | Extends ERC-20 tokens supporting EIP-2612-style authorization (permit). |

### Architecture Overview

**1. Entities**

	
- **Grantor:** the account granting permission.
- **Grantee:** the account or contract initiating pull().
- **Registry (optional):** stores active authorizations and revocation hashes.
- **Token Contract:** executes the transfer if the pull is valid.

---

**2. Flow**

 1. Grantor signs a structured authorization payload. 
 2. Grantee submits a pull() call referencing that payload. 
 3. Contract validates signature, scope, expiry, and non-revocation. 
 4. Funds move directly from Grantor to Grantee if conditions hold. 

---

**3. Consent Lifecycle**

- **Authorize → Pull → Revoke.**
Every state change remains cryptographically verifiable.

---

### Security & Revocation

 - **Revocable by Design:** a single hash update invalidates all pending pulls.
 - **Replay Protection:** nonce or timestamp embedded in authorization.
 - **Granular Scope:** amount, frequency, and counterparty-specific.
 - **Off-Chain Safety:** payloads can be pre-signed and shared without revealing balances.
 - **Transparency:** each pull emits standardized PullExecuted and PullRevoked events.

---

### Reference Implementation Notes
 - Solidity prototype aligns with EIP-20 and EIP-2612 conventions.
 - Registries may exist on- or off-chain depending on context (retail vs institutional).
 - Implementation MUST provide constant-time signature checks and revert on stale or invalid authorizations.
 - Wallet integrations SHOULD display pull permissions in human-readable form.

---

### Rationale

Permissioned-Pull adds timing as a programmable dimension to digital value.
Rather than redefining money, it defines motion: how liquidity rebalances within consent.
This standard allows stablecoins and tokenized assets to operate continuously — before failure instead of after — reducing systemic latency across DeFi and institutional rails alike.

---

### Backwards Compatibility

 - Fully compatible with existing ERC-20 tokens using off-chain signing gateways.
 - Backwards-safe for smart contracts unaware of pull() since authorization validation is externalized.

### Appendix

**A. Example Struct**

~~~
struct PullAuthorization {
    address owner;
    address receiver;
    address token;
    uint256 limit;
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 expiry;
    bytes32 revocationHash;
    bytes signature;
}
~~~

**B. Example Call**

~~~
function pull(PullAuthorization calldata auth, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == auth.receiver, "unauthorized");
    require(block.timestamp <= auth.expiry, "expired");
    require(!revoked[auth.revocationHash], "revoked");
    verifySignature(auth);
    IERC20(auth.token).transferFrom(auth.owner, auth.receiver, amount);
}
